        <h1>Should NYC ban non-essential motor-vehicles?</h1>
        <img src=no-cars.png border="2">
        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>NYC's #1 cause of greenhouse gases come from vehicles, the average vehicle speed is 4.7 mph in Manhattan, and pretty much majority of the road goes to vehicles leaving minimal walking space for pedestrians. With climate change affecting NYC too, we need to look at traffic collisions and fatalities versus the use of protected bike lines, express bus lanes, and other alternative public transportation. Possible solutions may be be finding if banning non-essential vehicles would lower NYC's greenhouse gas emissions, lower commute time for New Yorkers, and/or lower traffic collisions and fatalities city-wide.</p>
